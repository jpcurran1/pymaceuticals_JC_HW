## Pymaceuticals Matplotlib Homework
# Introduction
In this homework assingment we analyzed data regarding mice tumor size, and the effects different drug treatments had on the size of tumors over time. There is relativly equal distribution of mouse genders across the studies done with a variet of mouse sizes. We were able to graph several different visuals from this data using both pandas and matplotlib and used those visuals to help drive some conclusions. We were also able to do some statistics to find correlation values between size of the tumors and weight of the mice. Below are three observations from those visuals. 

# Observations 
These three observations can also be found in the first box of code in my jupyter notebook file. 
1. Based on the box plot, Capomulin and Ramicane have smaller final tumor volumes than infubinol and ceftamin. 
2. While on the Capomulin regimen, mouse b128 showed steady avg. decline in tumor volume hitting the smallest tumor volume around 35 days, but showed steady tumor growth after day 35. 
3. Based on the regression model, it looks like there is a relationship between mouse weight and avg. tumor volume: for mice on capomulin, in general, the more a mouse weighs, the larger the tumor will be.
